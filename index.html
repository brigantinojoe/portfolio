                <p>Joe Brigantino is a California native from the Monterey Bay area with a catholic upbringing.
                    During his time at San Diego State University, he came upon faithful believers who shared the Gospel
                    with him.
                    <br><br>
                    Joe has known the Josephs throughout his time in the CO ministry. Nicole and Joe knew they wanted to
                    be a part of the church plant as soon as they heard of it. Now using his gifts of organization and
                    working with numbers, he has joyfully joined the Center City family and uses his talents as the
                    Finance Director. You can also catch him on Sunday mornings playing the cajon or guitar for worship
                    time and hanging out with the youth group as a leader alongside his wife.</p>
